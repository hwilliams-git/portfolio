Repo of small projects to demonstrate my skills.

I am a recent Software Development and Cyber Security graduate. So, these scripts are simple and beginner level, which means they my not be to their fully optimized potential yet. Any scripts I post--that are written in a certain language, but not another--I can write in a different langauge if needed. The langauges I have recently worked with are C, C#, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. I will do my best to upload duplicates to match each language, but it will take time. So, if what I have posted so far is not a sufficent demonstration, please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to supply the requested scripts.

I am a recent Software Development (2018) and Cyber Security/Operations (2020) graduate. Any scripts I post--that are written in a certain language, but not another--I can write in a different langauge if needed. The langauges I have recently worked with are C, C#, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and SQL. If what I have posted so far is not a sufficent demonstration of what you may be looking for, please feel free to contact me and I will do my best to supply any requested scripts.
